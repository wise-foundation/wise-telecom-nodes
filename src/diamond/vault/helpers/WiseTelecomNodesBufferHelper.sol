/**
 * @dev Buffer / overhang sweep logic. The contract must hold at
 * least two weeks of forward interest at the configured
 * `bufferInterestRate` on the share supply PLUS the settled
 * `totalCashedInterest` liability users can already claim on
 * demand; anything above that combined reserve is "overhang" and
 * can be swept to the registered `workerAddress` by any address
 * master has granted in the `isSweeper` allowlist. The liability
 * term means a sweep can never take the cash a custodian
 * pre-funded for pending claims. With zero share supply the
 * reserve is the liability alone — cashed interest stays claimable
 * after every share has exited.
 *
 * Principal is `totalSupply()` — queued shares are already counted
 * there (they move from the user's `balanceOf` to the queue's
 * `balanceOf` on `joinQue`, never minted/burned).
