/**
 * @title MoveOutPropertiesTest
 * @dev Dual-engine property suite for MOV-1, the same-chain move-out
 * cap-relocation law.
 *
 * A move-out relocates deposit-cap budget with the principal: after
 * `_burn(msg.sender, amount)` the helper calls `_reduceDepositCap`
 * (`totalDepositCap -= amount`), so cap and supply drop in lockstep,
 * per-vault room (`totalDepositCap - totalSupply`) is invariant and
 * the destination's matching `_raiseDepositCap` conserves mesh-wide
 * Σ totalDepositCap. Pending interest is no longer compounded by the
 * move — the facet's `assignInterest` modifier banks it into
 * `cashedInterest` without minting, and the internal `_executeMoveOut`
 * proven here touches no interest state at all, so the exact-delta law
 * carries no pending term and no `USD_TOKEN` moves.
 *
 * Tractability mirrors the interest suite: the mover and peer are
 * concrete (mapping keys stay concrete), `interestRate` is concrete
 * `2000` and the sync delta is a concrete one year, so a nonzero
 * pending `floor(balance / 5)` stands on the mover's balance ready to
 * expose any residual compound mint. Balance, move amount and cap are
 * symbolic under the reachable-state precondition
 * `totalSupply <= totalDepositCap` (cap-below-supply states are
 * unconstructible on-chain since `setTotalDepositCap` floors at the
 * live supply and every relocation shifts cap and supply equally).
