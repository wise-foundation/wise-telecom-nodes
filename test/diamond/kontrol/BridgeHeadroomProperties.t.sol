/**
 * @title BridgeHeadroomPropertiesTest
 * @dev Dual-engine property suite for BRG-5, the bridge
 * room-conservation law behind the plain deposit-cap check
 * (`WiseTelecomNodesCrossChainHelper` + `_checkDepositCap`):
 *
 *   room := totalDepositCap - totalSupply
 *
 * Relocations MOVE deposit-cap budget with the shares. A bridge-IN
 * raises `totalDepositCap` by `amount` (`_raiseDepositCap`, before
 * the mint) and mints `amount`, so the two sides move in lockstep and
 * room is preserved — the receive-path mint can mathematically never
 * exceed the raised cap, and `ccipReceive` carries no economic revert
 * path at all (only the router, peer, replay and zero-amount guards).
 * A bridge-OUT burns `amount` and lowers `totalDepositCap` by
 * `amount` (`_reduceDepositCap` after the burn), so room is preserved
 * on the way out as well and the mesh-wide cap sum is conserved by
 * user flows.
 *
 * Both properties compare room in all-addition form —
 *
 *   capAfter + supplyBefore == capBefore + supplyAfter
 *
 * with the per-side deltas stated additively as well
 * (`capAfter == capBefore + amount` on receive,
 * `capAfter + amount == capBefore` on bridge-out) — because
 * subtraction forms would demand underflow side conditions on the
 * symbolic pre-state. Every operand is bounded by `MAX_BASE`, so the
 * sums stay far below 2**256. The pre-state assumes
 * `supply <= cap`, the reachable-state invariant the cap-setter
 * floor (`DepositCapBelowSupply`) and cap-checked mints enforce
 * on-chain.
 *
 * Every `testFuzz_*` is (a) fuzzable by Foundry (`forge test`) and (b)
 * symbolically provable by Kontrol
 * (`kontrol prove --match-test 'BridgeHeadroomPropertiesTest.<fn>'`).
 * As in the QLV-5 suite, the payload is pinned to the 64-byte legacy
 * `(address, uint256)` shape and the message id is a concrete
 * representative (a fully symbolic mapping key does not terminate);
 * the amount, the pre-supply and the pre-cap stay symbolic. The
 * out-path runs against this test contract acting as a zero-fee CCIP
 * router (`getFee` / `ccipSend` below) with the peer pinned to the
 * local decimals, so the burned local amount and the relocated cap
 * budget coincide exactly as they do on a live same-decimals lane;
 * the decimals-scaling dimension only affects the DESTINATION amount,
 * never the local burn the cap relocation records.
