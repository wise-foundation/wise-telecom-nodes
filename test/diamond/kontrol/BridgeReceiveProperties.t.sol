/**
 * @title BridgeReceivePropertiesTest
 * @dev Dual-engine property suite for QLV-5, the bridge-receive
 * atomicity law:
 *
 *   `processedMessageId[id] == true  ⟺  the mint for id succeeded`
 *
 * Between the burn on the source chain and the mint here, a user's
 * shares exist only as an in-flight CCIP message. The one failure mode
 * that would destroy them forever is a message marked processed
 * WITHOUT its mint (or a mint without its mark, allowing a double
 * spend). Because the flag write and the mint share one transaction,
 * the ⟺ reduces to per-execution lemmas Kontrol can prove over all
 * inputs: a successful delivery always sets the flag AND mints exactly
 * the payload amount; a failed delivery reverts wholesale, leaving the
 * flag unset so CCIP manual re-execution can retry; a marked message
 * can never mint again.
 *
 * Every `testFuzz_*` is (a) fuzzable by Foundry (`forge test`) and (b)
 * symbolically provable by Kontrol
 * (`kontrol prove --match-test 'BridgeReceivePropertiesTest.<fn>'`).
 * The payload is pinned to its two length shapes — the 64-byte legacy
 * `(address, uint256)` encoding and one referral-carrying
 * `(address, uint256, bytes)` encoding — because the decode branch is
 * selected purely by payload length; amounts, pre-balances and gate
 * flags stay symbolic. The message id is a concrete representative
 * (the symbolic engine does not terminate on a fully symbolic mapping
 * key, and no code path reads the id's content — it is only a lookup
 * key); the id dimension is covered by the Foundry fuzz campaign.
 *
 * The receive path carries NO economic gate: beyond the router
 * authentication, the peer enabled + match checks, the replay flag
 * and the `amount > 0` sanity check, delivery is unconditional. The
 * relocated deposit-cap budget arrives with the shares —
 * `totalDepositCap += amount` immediately before the uncapped mint —
 * so the mint can mathematically never exceed the raised cap. Each
 * lemma therefore also pins the cap delta: a successful delivery
 * raises `totalDepositCap` by exactly the payload amount, a failed
 * delivery leaves it untouched.
